# Marketplace Liquidity Analysis - Peerspace Case Study

## 🎯 Project Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project identifying **$487K in monthly revenue opportunity** for Peerspace's two-sided marketplace through liquidity optimization. This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics capabilities from SQL analysis through machine learning to executive presentation.

**Key Achievement**: Discovered that targeted supply-demand interventions in specific metros could improve conversion rates by 15-20% with 192% ROI in 90 days.

## 📊 Project Components

### 1. SQL Analysis (`sql/`)
- **Complex Queries**: 20+ production-ready SQL queries using CTEs, window functions, and statistical calculations
- **Liquidity Scoring**: Created composite metric measuring marketplace health
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with indexes, reducing execution time by 60%

**Key Insight**: Austin's 28% conversion rate vs. San Francisco's 52% indicates critical supply shortage

### 2. Python Predictive Modeling (`notebooks/`)
- **3 ML Models Built**:
  - Conversion Prediction (78% accuracy)
  - Demand Forecasting (85% accuracy, MAE: 8.2)
  - Liquidity Score Prediction (R²: 0.85)
- **Price Elasticity Analysis**: Discovered 6x variation in price sensitivity across venue types
- **Market Segmentation**: K-means clustering identified 3 distinct market segments

**Key Insight**: Meeting rooms are 6x more price-sensitive than rooftops

### 3. Tableau Dashboard (`dashboards/`)
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Parameter-driven filtering across all views
- **Executive Summary**: Single-page health overview
- **Predictive Views**: ML model outputs integrated
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for phone/tablet viewing

### 4. Business Recommendations (`presentations/`)
- **Quantified Impact**: $487K monthly revenue opportunity
- **Prioritized Roadmap**: 90-day implementation plan
- **ROI Calculations**: 192% return on $500K investment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identified and addressed key risks

## 💡 Key Findings

### Critical Issues Discovered
1. **Austin Supply Crisis**: Only 45 venues serving 1,200+ monthly searches
2. **LA Demand Problem**: 180+ venues but only 8.2% utilization  
3. **Pricing Inefficiencies**: Elastic venues overpriced, inelastic venues underpriced

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Austin emergency supply acquisition ($70K investment → $187K recovery)
2. **Short-term (30 days)**: LA demand generation campaign (40% search increase targeted)
3. **Medium-term (90 days)**: Dynamic pricing implementation (8-10% revenue increase)

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **SQL**: SQLite, Complex CTEs, Window Functions, Performance Optimization
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Random Forest, Time Series Analysis
- **Tableau**: Dual-axis charts, Parameter Actions, LOD Expressions, Dashboard Actions
- **Data**: 12 months marketplace data - 15,000+ searches, 5,000+ bookings, 600+ venues

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model | Metric | Performance | Business Impact |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Conversion Prediction | Accuracy | 78.3% | Prioritize high-value searches |
| Demand Forecast | MAE | 8.2 searches/day | Proactive supply planning |
| Liquidity Score | R² | 0.85 | 30-day advance warning |
| Price Elasticity | Confidence | 95% | Optimize pricing by venue type |
