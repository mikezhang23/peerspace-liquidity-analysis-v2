## Presentation Talking Points

### For Each Slide:

**Slide 1 (30 seconds)**
"I've completed a comprehensive analysis of Peerspace's marketplace liquidity and identified nearly half a million dollars in monthly revenue opportunity."

**Slide 5 (1 minute)**
"I created a composite liquidity score that measures marketplace health. Think of it like a credit score for each metro - it tells us instantly where we need to intervene."

**Slide 7 (1.5 minutes)**
"Austin is our biggest opportunity. We have incredible demand - 1,200 searches per month - but only 45 venues. This supply shortage is costing us $187,000 monthly. The good news? This is entirely fixable."

**Slide 10 (1 minute)**
"For Austin, I recommend an emergency supply sprint. With just $70,000 investment in incentives and dedicated resources, we can add 25 venues in 30 days and start recovering that lost revenue immediately."

**Slide 15 (1 minute)**
"The total investment is $500,000 over 90 days, but the return is $1.2 million - that's 140% ROI. More importantly, these changes create lasting improvements to marketplace health."
